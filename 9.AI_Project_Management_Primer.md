## 1. Core AI Concepts

### What is Artificial Intelligence?
AI is software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience.

### Machine Learning (ML)
The most common type of AI where systems learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.

**Key Types:**
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled examples (e.g., spam detection with emails marked as spam/not spam)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards (e.g., game-playing AI)

### Deep Learning
A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers. Powers most modern AI applications like image recognition, language translation, and voice assistants.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GPT-4).

## 2. Essential AI Terminology

### Model
The trained AI system that makes predictions or decisions. Think of it as the "brain" of your AI application.

### Training
The process of teaching an AI model using data. Can take hours to months depending on complexity.

### Inference
Using a trained model to make predictions on new data. This is what happens in production.

### Dataset
Collection of data used to train or test models. Quality and size are critical.

### Parameters
Internal settings the model learns during training. More parameters generally mean more capable (but more expensive) models.

### Fine-tuning
Adapting a pre-trained model for your specific use case with additional training.

### Tokens
Units of text (roughly 3-4 characters) that LLMs process. Important for cost estimation.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
How your application communicates with AI services (e.g., OpenAI API, Google AI API).

### Embeddings
Numerical representations of text, images, or other data that AI models can process.

### Prompt Engineering
Crafting effective instructions to get desired outputs from AI models.

### Phase 3: Model Development (4-16 weeks)
- **Activities:**
  - Select modeling approach (build vs. buy vs. fine-tune)
  - Develop and train models
  - Experiment with different architectures
  - Iterate based on performance
- **Note:** This is often iterative and experimental

  - Conduct bias and fairness testing
  - Perform user acceptance testing
  - Document model limitations

### Phase 5: Deployment (2-8 weeks)
- **Activities:**
  - Integrate model into production systems
  - Set up monitoring and logging
  - Establish rollback procedures
  - Plan for scaling

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Maintenance (Ongoing)
- **Activities:**
  - Monitor model performance over time
  - Detect model drift (performance degradation)
  - Retrain models as needed
  - Address edge cases and failures

## 4. Key Metrics for AI Projects

### Model Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions (simple but can be misleading)
- **Precision**: Of all positive predictions, how many were correct?

## 6. Build vs. Buy vs. Fine-Tune Decision Framework

### Build from Scratch
- **When:** Highly specialized domain, competitive advantage, sufficient resources
- **Pros:** Full control, customization
- **Cons:** Expensive ($$$$), time-consuming (6-18 months), requires ML expertise
- **Team Needed:** ML engineers, data scientists, MLOps engineers

### Use Pre-trained Models (API)
- **When:** Common use cases (chatbots, image recognition, translation)
- **Pros:** Fast deployment (days-weeks), lower cost ($$), proven performance
- **Cons:** Less control, ongoing API costs, vendor dependency
- **Team Needed:** Software engineers, API integration specialists

### Fine-tune Existing Models
- **When:** Need customization but can leverage pre-trained models
- **Pros:** Faster than building (4-12 weeks), better performance than generic ($$$)

## 8. Project Management Best Practices for AI

### Start with MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Solve ONE specific problem well before expanding
- Example: Before building a full customer service AI, start with FAQ automation

### Embrace Agile with Adjustments
- Use 2-4 week sprints for development
- Plan for experimentation time (not all approaches will work)
- Build in buffer for data preparation (often 50-80% of time)

### Establish Clear Success Criteria Early
- Define what "good enough" looks like
- Set both technical metrics (accuracy) and business metrics (ROI)
- Get stakeholder buy-in on thresholds

### Plan for the 80/20 Rule
- Getting to 80% accuracy might take 20% of time
- Getting from 80% to 95% might take the remaining 80%
- Decide if the extra effort is worth it

### Build in Feedback Loops
- Collect user feedback from day one
- Use production data to improve models
- Plan for regular model updates

### Maintain "Human in the Loop"
- Don't fully automate critical decisions initially
- Have humans review AI outputs, especially edge cases
- Gradually reduce human oversight as confidence grows

### Document Everything
- Model versions and performance
- Data sources and preprocessing steps
- Decisions made and why
- Known limitations and failure modes

## 11. Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **"We need more data"** (repeatedly, without clear targets)
⚠️ **No clear baseline** for comparison (how does AI compare to current solution?)
⚠️ **100% accuracy claims** (unrealistic in most real-world scenarios)
⚠️ **Lack of error analysis** (team can't explain why model fails)
⚠️ **No consideration of edge cases**
⚠️ **"Black box" mentality** (team can't explain model decisions)
⚠️ **Scope expansion** without MVP completion
⚠️ **No deployment plan** after months of development
⚠️ **Ignoring data privacy/ethics concerns**

## 12. AI Ethics & Responsible AI

### Key Principles
- **Fairness**: Ensure AI doesn't discriminate against protected groups
- **Transparency**: Users should know they're interacting with AI
- **Privacy**: Protect user data and comply with regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership when AI makes mistakes
- **Safety**: Prevent harmful outputs and unintended consequences

### Practical Steps
- Conduct bias audits on training data and model outputs
- Document data sources and model limitations
- Implement human oversight for high-stakes decisions
- Provide explanations for AI decisions when possible
- Establish governance and review processes

## 13. AI Project Timeline Reality Check

### Simple AI Project (Using APIs)
- Timeline: 6-12 weeks
- Example: Chatbot using OpenAI API for customer FAQs

### Medium Complexity (Fine-tuning)
- Timeline: 3-6 months
- Example: Custom document classification for legal contracts

### Complex Project (Custom Development)
- Timeline: 9-18 months
- Example: Computer vision system for manufacturing quality control

**Note:** Add 50% buffer for data-related challenges and experimentation.

## 14. Success Story Pattern

Most successful AI projects follow this pattern:

1. **Start Small**: One specific, high-value use case
2. **Prove Value**: Demonstrate ROI with MVP (3-6 months)
3. **Iterate**: Improve based on real-world feedback
4. **Scale**: Expand to related use cases
5. **Institutionalize**: Build AI capabilities into the organization
